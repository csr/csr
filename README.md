### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cesare and I'm a software engineer. Always excited to get my hands dirty with new things. Currently building projects with TypeScript and React (are you working in a remote team, or have friends around the world? Check out my latest project, [GeoVibes](https://geovibes.app)). I'm sometimes active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135714/cesare). See some my early projects at [cesare.io](https://cesare.io)
