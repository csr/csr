My name is Cesare and I'm a software engineer at Ericsson. Always excited to get my hands dirty with new things. Currently building projects with TypeScript and React. I'm sometimes active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135714/cesare). View some my early projects at [cesare.io](https://cesare.io)
