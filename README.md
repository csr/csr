### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Cesare and I'm a software engineer. Always excited to get my hands dirty with new things. 

- I'm sometimes active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135714/cesare). See some my early projects at [cesare.io](https://cesare.io).

- If you work in a remote team, or have friends around the world, and want to see the news, weather, events in their area, check out my latest side project [ðŸŒž GeoVibes](https://geovibes.app). Feedback welcome anytime.
