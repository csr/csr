### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cesare and I'm a frontend engineer at Ericsson with past backend and mobile development experience. In the past, I worked on several iOS apps, attended Apple WWDC as a scholar, interned at Twitter and Amazon, and contributed to Python Open Source projects through the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). 

I have experience with JavaScript (and TypeScript), some AWS services (Lambda, IAM, DynamoDB). Always excited to learn more (and fast). I enjoy crafting beautiful, interactive and powerful interfaces, but also diving deep into the backend and APIs.

I'm sometimes active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135714/cesare). I get excited when working on consumer products. View some my early projects at [cesare.io](https://cesare.io)
