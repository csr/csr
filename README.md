### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cesare and I'm currently contributing to Python Open Source projects through the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). In the past, I worked on several iOS apps, attended Apple WWDC as a scholar and interned at Twitter. I'll soon learn more about Autonomous Systems, Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning in a Master's Double Degree at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/) and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).
