### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cesare and I'm a frontend engineer at Ericsson with past backend and mobile development experience. In the past, I worked on several iOS apps, attended Apple WWDC as a scholar, interned at Twitter and Amazon, and contributed to Python Open Source projects through the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). Always excited to get my hands dirty with new things. Currently building projects with TypeScript and React. 

My favorite day-to-day activities include collaborating with UX and backend teams, crafting beautiful, interactive and powerful interfaces, mentoring junior engineers and learning from software architects or senior engineers, and diving deep in backend code to debug an unexpected API response.

I'm sometimes active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1135714/cesare). I get excited when working on consumer products. View some my early projects at [cesare.io](https://cesare.io)
